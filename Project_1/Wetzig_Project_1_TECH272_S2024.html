<h1>Justin Wetzig</h1>
<p>I was born in Baltimore, Maryland and have lived here my entire life, except for 3 years when I was an infant we lived in Germany. My father, at the time, worked for the government and we lived in Weisbaden, Germany. My younger sister was born there. I moved from Columbia, Maryland to Frederick when I was in elementary school and have grown up here. I graduated from Salisbury University in 2019 with a history degree, but minored in Film and New Media Art, where I pursued many of my creative passions.</p>
<p>Currently, I work <strong>full time as a Graphic Designer at a screen printing company in Frederick, MD.</strong> My day-to-day involves getting client artwork prepared for production. In my spare time I like to watch movies, listen to music, and when the weather is nice I enjoy riding my bike. </p>
<p>Ten years from now, I hope to be incorporating both my graphic designs skills and web development skills into a successful career. I hope to use these skills obtained in this class as a solid foundation for a prosperous career. Outside of professional pursuits, I'd like to travel more both inside the U.S. and abroad. <em>I have not been further west than Tennessee</em>, and would love to visit the Pacific Northwest someday. </p>
